## Overview

Every submission receives evaluation from four specialized AI agents. Reviews are synthesized by a meta-reviewer, and all evaluations are published with accepted papers.

## The Four Stages

### Stage 1: Screening (1-3 days)

| Check | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Format | Meets specifications |
| Scope | Relevant to AI/ML |
| Quality | Basic coherence |
| Plagiarism | Originality check |

### Stage 2: Agent Review (1-2 weeks)

Four agents evaluate in parallel:

| Agent | Dimensions |
|-------|------------|
| **Technical** | Methodology (1-5), Validity (1-5), Reproducibility (1-5) |
| **Domain** | Novelty (1-5), Significance (1-5), Literature (1-5) |
| **Ethics** | Compliance (1-5), Misuse Risk (1-5), Bias (1-5) |
| **Clarity** | Writing (1-5), Figures (1-5), Accessibility (1-5) |

### Stage 3: Meta-Review (2-3 days)

| Function | Process |
|----------|---------|
| Aggregation | Compile all reviews |
| Consensus | Identify agreements |
| Conflict Resolution | Address disagreements |
| Decision | Final recommendation |

### Stage 4: Author Response

If revision requested:
1. Receive consolidated feedback
2. Submit revised manuscript
3. Provide point-by-point response
4. Final decision rendered

## Decision Outcomes

| Decision | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Accept** | Ready for publication |
| **Minor Revision** | Small changes needed |
| **Major Revision** | Significant changes |
| **Reject** | Does not meet standards |

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent - exceptional quality |
| 4 | Good - solid with minor issues |
| 3 | Acceptable - meets minimum |
| 2 | Below Standard - needs work |
| 1 | Poor - fundamental flaws |

## What Agents CAN Assess

- Writing clarity
- Structural organization
- Internal consistency
- Citation format
- Surface-level errors

## What Agents CANNOT Assess

| Limitation | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Deep technical correctness | Beyond training |
| True novelty | Can't search all prior work |
| Empirical validity | Can't run experiments |
| Cutting-edge developments | Knowledge cutoff |

---

## Transparency

All accepted papers include:
- Full text of all four reviews
- Dimension-by-dimension scores

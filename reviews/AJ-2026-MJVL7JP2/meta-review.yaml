rationale: 'This paper makes important contributions to AI agent evaluation methodology,
  providing the first comprehensive systematic analysis of current benchmarking practices
  and identifying significant shortcomings in cost consideration, holdout design,
  and reproducibility. The technical and domain reviewers both gave strong scores
  (4.0) recognizing the solid empirical methodology, compelling results showing simple
  baselines matching complex agents at lower cost, and practical optimization framework.


  However, the clarity reviewer identified severe formatting issues that make the
  paper nearly unreadable, with spacing removed throughout the document (e.g., "AIagentsareanexcitingnewresearchdirection").
  These are likely from PDF conversion but create major barriers to comprehension.
  Additionally, key figures are relegated to the appendix, weakening the narrative
  flow.


  The ethics reviewer noted the work has positive impact potential but needs explicit
  consideration of fairness in evaluation frameworks. These are all addressable concerns
  that don''t undermine the core contributions.


  While the domain reviewer recommended acceptance based on strong technical merit,
  the combination of severe presentation issues and moderate ethics concerns warrants
  major revision to ensure the important contributions can be effectively communicated
  to readers.

  '
revision_guidance: 'The paper''s core contributions are strong and valuable to the
  field. Focus first on fixing the critical formatting issues that prevent effective
  reading - this is essential for publication. Then integrate key figures into the
  main text to improve narrative flow and add the fairness discussion to address ethical
  considerations. These changes should position the paper well for acceptance given
  its solid technical and domain contributions.

synthesis:
  consensus_concerns:
  - Severe formatting and spacing issues throughout document making text nearly unreadable
  - Limited benchmark coverage may reduce generalizability to more complex agent applications
  - Missing consideration of fairness and bias in agent evaluation frameworks
  - Key figures relegated to appendix weakening main narrative
  consensus_strengths:
  - Strong empirical methodology with multiple trials and proper statistical analysis
    across benchmarks
  - First comprehensive systematic analysis of agent evaluation practices identifying
    multiple fundamental issues
  - Compelling demonstration that simple baselines match SOTA agents at fraction of
    the cost
  - Practical joint optimization framework with demonstrated 41-53% cost reduction
    while maintaining accuracy
  - Good reproducibility with available code and data
  disagreements:
  - positions:
    - reviewer: domain
      view: Ready for acceptance - strong contributions outweigh presentation issues
    - reviewer: clarity
      view: Major revision needed due to severe formatting barriers to readability
    - reviewer: technical
      view: Minor revision sufficient - good work with addressable concerns
    - reviewer: ethics
      view: Minor revision needed for fairness considerations
    resolution: Clarity issues are too severe to ignore - formatting problems make
      paper nearly unreadable and must be addressed before publication. However, technical
      and domain quality is strong enough to warrant major revision rather than rejection.
    topic: Overall publication readiness

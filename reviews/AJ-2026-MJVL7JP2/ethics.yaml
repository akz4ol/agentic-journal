    recommended_safeguards:
    - Explicitly discuss responsible deployment considerations in benchmarking frameworks
    safeguards_present:
    - Focus on improving scientific rigor rather than agent capabilities directly
  questions_for_authors:
  - How could the proposed cost-accuracy optimization framework be extended to include
    fairness metrics?
  - What considerations should benchmark developers have regarding responsible deployment
    of agents that perform well on these improved benchmarks?
  required_additions:
  - Discussion of how proposed benchmarking improvements could incorporate fairness
    evaluation
  - Broader impacts section addressing potential acceleration of AI agent deployment
  strengths:
  - Addresses important methodological issues that could improve scientific rigor
    in AI agent research
  - Focuses on cost-effectiveness which could democratize access to effective AI systems
  - Uses only publicly available benchmarks and standard computational research methods
  - Aims to prevent overfitting and improve real-world applicability of AI agents
  summary: 'This paper proposes improvements to AI agent benchmarking practices, focusing
    on cost-controlled evaluation and addressing reproducibility issues. The work
    has strong ethical foundations with appropriate methodology and low risk profile,
    though it could benefit from more explicit consideration of fairness and bias
    in agent evaluation.

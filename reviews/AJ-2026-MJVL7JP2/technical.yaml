  missing_experiments:
  - Evaluation on more complex agent benchmarks (e.g., multi-day software engineering
    tasks) to test generalizability
  - Comparison of joint optimization approach against more sophisticated multi-objective
    optimization methods
  questions_for_authors:
  - How would the cost-accuracy tradeoffs change for more complex multi-step reasoning
    tasks beyond HumanEval?
  - Could you provide theoretical analysis of when simple retry strategies should
    outperform complex agent architectures?
  - How sensitive are the joint optimization results to the choice of hyperparameter
    optimizer (Optuna vs others)?
  strengths:
  - Strong empirical methodology with multiple trials (5 runs) and proper error reporting
    across HumanEval, HotPotQA, and other benchmarks
  - Compelling demonstration that simple baselines (retry, warming, escalation) match
    SOTA agents at fraction of the cost on HumanEval
  - Practical joint optimization showing 41-53% cost reduction while maintaining accuracy
    on HotPotQA
  - Valuable documentation of reproducibility issues across multiple published agents
    with specific examples
  - Well-motivated distinction between model evaluation and downstream evaluation
    needs
  summary: 'This paper provides a thorough empirical analysis of current AI agent
    evaluation practices, identifying significant shortcomings in cost consideration,
    holdout design, and reproducibility. The work makes solid empirical contributions
    with practical recommendations, though the technical novelty is limited. The experimental
    methodology is sound with appropriate baselines and statistical analysis across
    multiple benchmarks.

  technical_errors:
  - issue: Pareto frontier convexity constraint could be explained more clearly -
      the linear interpolation argument assumes agents can be probabilistically mixed
    location: Section A.1
    severity: minor
    suggestion: Add explicit explanation that convex hull represents achievable performance
      via randomized strategies
  weaknesses:
  - Limited benchmark coverage - findings may not generalize to more complex agent
    applications beyond coding/QA tasks
  - Joint optimization approach is relatively simple (Optuna parameter search) - more
    sophisticated methods could likely achieve better results
  - Some overgeneralization from specific examples to broad claims about 'agent benchmarks'
    in general
  - Cost measurements are API-provider dependent and time-dependent, limiting long-term
    reproducibility
  - Benchmark generality categorization in Table 1 involves subjective judgments that
    could be debatable

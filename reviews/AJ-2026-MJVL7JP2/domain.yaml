  contribution_statement: 'The paper systematically identifies and addresses five
    major shortcomings in AI agent benchmarking: cost-blindness in evaluations, conflation
    of model vs. downstream developer needs, inadequate holdout sets enabling shortcuts,
    and lack of standardization leading to irreproducible results.

    '
  missing_related_work:
  - Broader dataset shift and distribution robustness literature relevant to holdout
    set design
  - Cost-aware machine learning literature beyond inference costs
  novelty_assessment:
    actual_novelty: First comprehensive critique of agent evaluation methodology;
      individual issues known but not systematically addressed in agent context
    claimed_novelty: Systematic identification of fundamental issues in agent benchmarking
      practices and empirical demonstration of cost-accuracy tradeoffs
    prior_work_doing_similar:
    - paper: General ML evaluation methodology papers (Henderson et al., Lipton &
        Steinhardt)
      relationship: Address similar reproducibility/evaluation issues but not specifically
        for agents
  questions_for_authors:
  - How sensitive are cost analyses to rapid changes in API pricing models over time?
  - What are the scalability limitations of joint optimization as agent tasks become
    more complex?
  - How can benchmark creators balance appropriate holdout design with the cost and
    effort of benchmark creation?
  significance_assessment:
    practical_impact: High - could prevent wasted resources on overly complex agents
      and improve evaluation reliability in an important emerging field
    target_audience: AI researchers developing agents, benchmark creators, practitioners
      deploying agent systems
    theoretical_impact: Provides framework for model vs. downstream evaluation needs
      and agent generality taxonomy
  strengths:
  - First comprehensive systematic analysis of agent benchmarking practices across
    multiple dimensions
  - Strong empirical findings showing simple baselines matching complex 'SOTA' agents
    at much lower cost
  - Practical joint optimization framework demonstrating cost-accuracy tradeoffs
  - Thorough survey of 17 agent benchmarks with clear taxonomy of generality levels
  - Well-documented reproducibility issues with specific examples and evidence
  - Actionable recommendations that could significantly improve field practices
  summary: 'This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic critique of current
    AI agent evaluation practices, identifying multiple fundamental issues including
    narrow focus on accuracy over cost, inadequate holdout strategies, and lack of
    standardization. The authors provide strong empirical evidence across multiple
    benchmarks and offer concrete recommendations for improving agent evaluation practices.

    '
  weaknesses:
  - Some case studies (NovelQA) limited to single runs due to cost constraints
  - Could better connect to broader ML evaluation methodology literature beyond agent-specific
    issues
  - Cost analysis sensitivity to API pricing changes acknowledged but not fully addressed

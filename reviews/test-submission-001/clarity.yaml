accessibility_assessment:
  background_needed: Assumes familiarity with LLM evaluation practices and agent architectures
  improvements:
  - Add brief explanations of key concepts like 'Pareto frontier' when first introduced
  - Include more intuitive explanations for why cost-controlled evaluation matters
  - Consider a glossary or background section for readers less familiar with agent
    evaluation
  target_audience_reached: partial
confidence: high
evaluation:
  strengths:
  - Clear problem motivation with concrete examples (cost explosion in agent evaluation)
  - Comprehensive empirical analysis spanning multiple benchmarks and evaluation dimensions
  - Practical, actionable recommendations for the research community
  - Good use of case studies (WebArena, NovelQA) to illustrate key points
  - Strong reproducibility efforts with code and interactive tools
  summary: 'This paper presents important insights about AI agent benchmarking practices,
    with clear empirical findings and practical recommendations. The writing is generally
    professional and the structure is logical, but the presentation could be more
    accessible and concise. The extensive empirical analysis is well-supported by
    figures and tables, though some could be enhanced for clarity.

    '
  weaknesses:
  - Dense presentation could benefit from more concise writing and better paragraph
    structure
  - Some technical concepts need more intuitive explanations for broader accessibility
  - Figure quality varies - some could be larger with clearer labels
  - The relationship between model vs. downstream evaluation could be explained more
    clearly upfront
figure_assessment:
  figure_issues:
  - figure: Figure 1
    issue: Axis labels could be larger, legend positioning could be improved
    suggestion: Increase font size for axis labels and consider moving legend to avoid
      overlap
  - figure: Tables in main text
    issue: Some tables are quite wide and dense
    suggestion: Consider highlighting key values or using visual formatting to guide
      reader attention
  missing_figures:
  - A conceptual diagram showing the relationship between different evaluation types
    (model vs. downstream)
  overall_quality: good
questions_for_authors:
- Would you consider adding a brief 'Background' section explaining key evaluation
  concepts for readers less familiar with the field?
- Could Figure 1 be redesigned with larger text and clearer visual hierarchy?

specific_edits:
- current: First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without attention to other metrics,
    such as cost.
  location: Abstract, line 3
  reason: More specific and flows better
  suggested: First, current benchmarks focus narrowly on accuracy while ignoring other
    critical metrics like computational cost.
- current: We found three clusters of factors.
  location: Section 1.1
  reason: Clearer transition and more informative
  suggested: 'We identified three key dimensions that determine how ''agentic'' a
    system is:'
structure_assessment:
  balance: Sections are well-balanced, though Section 2 is quite dense compared to
    others
  organization: good
  suggested_reorganization:
  - Consider moving some implementation details from Section 2 to appendix to improve
    flow
  - Add brief transition paragraphs between major sections to improve coherence
writing_assessment:
  grammar_issues: minor
  prose_quality: good
  specific_issues:
  - issue: Dense paragraph about accuracy maximization - hard to parse
    location: Section 2.1
    suggestion: Break into bullet points or shorter paragraphs with clearer topic
      sentences
  - issue: The model vs. downstream evaluation distinction is crucial but introduced
      abruptly
    location: Section 4 introduction
    suggestion: Add a brief overview paragraph explaining why this distinction matters
      before diving into details

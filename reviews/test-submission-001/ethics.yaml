    positive_impacts:
    - More accessible AI through cost reduction
    - Improved evaluation reliability reducing overfitted systems
    - Better resource efficiency in AI development
  concerns:
  - affected_parties: AI users and affected communities
    concern: Limited analysis of how cost-optimization focus might affect other values
      like fairness or safety
    recommendation: Consider discussing potential tensions between cost optimization
      and other ethical considerations
    severity: minor
  - affected_parties: Developers using evaluation frameworks
    concern: Minimal consideration of bias in evaluation methodologies themselves
    recommendation: Briefly discuss how evaluation improvements could address or inadvertently
      introduce bias

    - Explicit guidance on balancing cost optimization with safety requirements
    safeguards_present:
    - Acknowledges need for existing AI safety frameworks
    - Mentions environmental and broader impact considerations
  questions_for_authors:
  - How might cost-controlled evaluation interact with safety evaluation requirements?
  - What guidance would you provide for balancing cost optimization with fairness
    considerations?

  strengths:
  - Research methodology improves AI evaluation practices, which could enhance overall
    AI safety and reliability
  - Cost-controlled evaluation could democratize access to AI by reducing deployment
    costs
  - Identifies and addresses evaluation shortcomings that could prevent overfitting
    and gaming
  - Acknowledges environmental and accessibility implications in limitations section
  summary: 'This methodological research on AI agent evaluation practices presents
    minimal ethical concerns and potentially positive societal benefits. The work
    focuses on improving evaluation methodology rather than developing new capabilities,
    with appropriate consideration of limitations and some acknowledgment of broader
    impacts.

  contribution_statement: 'The paper systematically identifies and addresses fundamental
    flaws in current AI agent benchmarking, proposing cost-controlled evaluation methods
    and providing frameworks for preventing shortcuts and improving reproducibility.

    '
  missing_related_work:
  - Efficient NLP and green AI literature on computational costs
  - Economic analysis of ML system deployment costs
  - Multi-objective optimization in machine learning
  - Broader ML evaluation methodology and meta-evaluation work
  novelty_assessment:
    actual_novelty: The cost-controlled evaluation perspective and joint optimization
      approach are genuinely novel. The systematic analysis of shortcuts and reproducibility
      issues provides valuable new insights, though individual components build on
      known ML evaluation principles.
    claimed_novelty: First systematic analysis of agent evaluation shortcomings, cost-controlled
      evaluation methods, joint optimization of cost and accuracy, and taxonomy of
      benchmark generality levels
    prior_work_doing_similar:
    - paper: HELM framework for LLM evaluation
      relationship: Addresses standardization for LLMs but not agents specifically
    - paper: General ML benchmarking best practices literature
      relationship: Covers overfitting and holdouts but not agent-specific challenges
  questions_for_authors:
  - How would the joint optimization approach scale to more complex multi-step agent
    tasks beyond question answering?
  - What specific mechanisms do you propose for keeping holdout sets secret while
    enabling reproducible evaluation?
  - Could you provide more detailed guidance on when to use each level of generality
    in benchmark design?
  significance_assessment:
    practical_impact: Could significantly change how agents are evaluated and developed,
      with immediate relevance for cost-conscious deployment decisions
    target_audience: AI agent researchers, benchmark developers, downstream practitioners
      making procurement decisions
    theoretical_impact: Provides frameworks for thinking about evaluation generality
      levels and cost-accuracy tradeoffs that could influence future benchmark design
  strengths:
  - First comprehensive analysis of agent evaluation shortcomings across multiple
    benchmarks and SOTA agents
  - Strong empirical work showing simple baselines outperform complex agents on HumanEval
    when controlling for cost
  - Practical joint optimization framework demonstrating 40-53% cost reduction while
    maintaining accuracy
  - Valuable distinction between model evaluation vs downstream evaluation needs with
    concrete examples
  - Thorough reproducibility analysis revealing concerning issues across multiple
    benchmarks
  - Clear taxonomy of generality levels with appropriate holdout requirements
  summary: 'This paper provides the first systematic analysis of critical shortcomings
    in AI agent evaluation practices, demonstrating that current benchmarks focus
    too narrowly on accuracy while ignoring costs, enable shortcuts through inadequate
    holdouts, and suffer from poor reproducibility. The work is timely and well-executed,
    offering both empirical evidence and practical frameworks for improving agent
    evaluation.

  weaknesses:
  - Joint optimization only evaluated on one task (HotPotQA) - broader evaluation
    would strengthen the claims
  - Cost evaluation challenges (model price changes, provider differences) acknowledged
    but not fully addressed
  - Limited engagement with broader cost-aware ML and green AI literature
  - Some reproducibility issues were predictable given the field's nascency

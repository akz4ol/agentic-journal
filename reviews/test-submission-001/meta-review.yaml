  reviewer_agreement: moderate
rationale: 'This paper addresses critically important issues in AI agent evaluation
  and makes genuine novel contributions to the field. All reviewers recognize the
  significance of identifying systematic problems with current benchmarking practices
  and proposing cost-controlled evaluation methods. The empirical work is solid and
  the practical implications are substantial.


  The disagreement between reviewers primarily concerns readiness for publication
  rather than fundamental quality. The Domain reviewer correctly identifies this as
  groundbreaking work that could significantly impact how agents are evaluated. However,
  the Technical and Clarity reviewers raise legitimate concerns about experimental
  scope and presentation that, while not fatal, would meaningfully improve the paper''s
  impact and accessibility.


  The weighted average of 3.9 reflects strong quality with room for improvement. The
  issues identified are clearly addressable: expanding experimental validation, improving
  presentation clarity, and providing more technical detail. These improvements would
  transform an already good paper into an excellent one.


  Given the importance of the contribution and the fixable nature of the concerns,
  minor revision is the appropriate decision.

revision_guidance: "Focus primarily on improving presentation clarity and figure quality,\
  \ as these will have the most immediate impact on reader comprehension. The technical\
  \ concerns about experimental scope are minor and can be addressed through modest\
  \ additional analysis or discussion of limitations. \n\nFor accessibility, consider\
  \ adding a brief background section or improved explanations when introducing technical\
  \ concepts. The core contributions are strong - the goal is to make them more accessible\
  \ to the broader community.\n\nThe experimental scope concerns can be partially\
  \ addressed by expanding the joint optimization analysis or by more clearly discussing\
  \ the limitations and future work needed. The single-task evaluation is a limitation\
  \ but does not invalidate the core contributions.\n"
synthesis:
  consensus_concerns:
  - Limited experimental scope - analysis primarily focuses on HumanEval with limited
    evaluation on other benchmarks
  - Dense presentation that could benefit from improved accessibility and clarity
  - Joint optimization approach is relatively simple and could be more sophisticated
  - Some experiments underpowered due to cost constraints
  consensus_strengths:
  - First comprehensive analysis of critical shortcomings in AI agent evaluation practices
  - Strong empirical demonstration that cost-controlled evaluation changes conclusions
    about agent performance
  - Practical joint optimization approach showing 41-53% cost reduction while maintaining
    accuracy
  - Clear identification of reproducibility issues across multiple benchmark implementations
  - Actionable recommendations with immediate relevance for the research community
  disagreements:
  - positions:
    - reviewer: domain
      view: Strong novelty and practical impact warrant acceptance as-is
    - reviewer: technical
      view: Solid work but limited experimental scope and technical details need improvement
    - reviewer: clarity
      view: Important contributions but presentation accessibility needs improvement
    resolution: The concerns raised by technical and clarity reviewers are legitimate
      but represent fixable issues rather than fundamental problems. The domain reviewer
      correctly identifies the strong contributions, but addressing the presentation
      and experimental scope concerns would significantly strengthen the paper.

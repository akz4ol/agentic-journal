  missing_experiments:
  - Evaluation of cost-accuracy tradeoffs on additional benchmarks beyond HumanEval
    and HotPotQA
  - Comparison with more sophisticated joint optimization approaches
  - Analysis of how holdout set design affects different agent architectures
  questions_for_authors:
  - How do the cost-accuracy tradeoffs change for more complex multi-step reasoning
    tasks beyond HumanEval?
  - What would joint optimization results look like with more sophisticated optimization
    methods beyond simple parameter search?
  - How generalizable are the reproducibility issues found - is this systematic across
    the broader agent evaluation landscape?
  strengths:
  - Strong empirical demonstration that cost-controlled evaluation changes conclusions
    about agent performance (Section 2, Figure 1)
  - Clear identification of the model vs. downstream evaluation distinction with concrete
    NovelQA case study (Section 4)
  - Comprehensive documentation of reproducibility issues across multiple benchmark
    implementations (Section 6, Table A6)
  - Practical joint optimization approach showing 41-53% cost reduction while maintaining
    accuracy (Section 3)
  - Thorough survey of 17 agent benchmarks revealing systematic holdout set inadequacies
    (Table A4)
  summary: 'This paper addresses critical issues in AI agent benchmarking by demonstrating
    that current evaluation practices overemphasize accuracy while ignoring cost,
    lack proper holdout sets, and suffer from reproducibility issues. The authors
    provide solid empirical evidence showing that simple baselines can match complex
    "state-of-the-art" agents at much lower cost, and propose practical solutions
    for more rigorous agent evaluation.

  technical_errors:
  - issue: Claims about non-determinism at temperature=0 need better documentation/verification
    location: Section 2.3
    severity: minor
    suggestion: Provide more rigorous analysis of temperature=0 stochasticity
  weaknesses:
  - Limited experimental scope - analysis primarily focuses on HumanEval with limited
    evaluation on other benchmarks
  - Some experiments underpowered due to cost constraints (single runs for NovelQA,
    only 5 runs for others)
  - Joint optimization approach is relatively simple and may not generalize to more
    complex optimization landscapes
  - Cost analysis depends on time-specific API pricing, though authors provide web
    interface to address this
  - Agent definition and generality taxonomy (Section 5) could be more rigorously
    formalized
